# dhbw-compilerbau

This repository contains all projects that are used in the "Compilerbau" (compiler construction) course in the summer semester 2016 at the Cooperative State University "DHBW" in Karlsruhe, Germany.
The code base for every project is provided by our professor and it is then extended by me (at least I do my best :-)) to finally fit the requirements of the program.
